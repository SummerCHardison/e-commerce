# e-commerce

## Description

This application is a tracker for an e-commerce site. It was made using JavaScript, postgres, sql, and several npm dependancies. The application allows you to view all, view one using id, create, update, and delete from the database tables dedicated to categories, porducts, and tags for the products using requests. It was made as a way to gain practice with object relational mapping, and to make it easier to keep track of things for an e-commerce site
